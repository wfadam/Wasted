A taste of using Kotlin for NAND flash test program development

			Abstract

  For years, Java is used as mainstream language in NAND flash test program development.
By Jun 2018, we accumulated more than 110,000 lines of Java code. It keeps growing everyday.
However, Java has its own drawbacks especially in Java 6.

  Java is verbose, very verbose. Test engineers have to implement a simple function with 
multiple lines of code. It's hardly to have an one liner code solution. 
  Java is error prone. The billion dollar mistake, dreaded "NullPointerException", may 
crash the test program in the middle of testing and cost huge efforts to debug and fix.

  Kotlin to the rescue and here is why:
  1. Kotlin is succinct. It means less code less error.
  2. Kotlin is null safe
  3. Kotlin can use all existing Java libraries.
  4. Kotlin gets support from established companies in IT industry
  5. Kotlin has a low learning curve
